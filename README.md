## GrandMaster-Level Chess Robot (BETA)

This is a terminal chess-playing AI. Check out our [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/) (not yet implemented)

So far, I've written the basic logistics of the game. Some day, I hope I can redo this repo in pure C++, but Segmentation fault (Core dumped).

I might also implement UCI support eventually once I've finished everything.
